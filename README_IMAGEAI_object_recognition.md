In this project we are going to do object recognition in image. here we are passing a image path in coding. 
Script will detect all the objects in the image it will saved as "imagenew.jepg" in projectfolder and extracted images willbe stored in extractedimages folder.
Object position in image will be printed in console.

Please follow the below steps

1) Download and install Python 3 from official Python Language website

https://python.org

2) Install the following dependencies via pip:

i. Tensorflow

pip install tensorflow

ii. Numpy

pip install numpy

iii. SciPy

pip install scipy

iv. OpenCV

pip install opencv-python

v. Pillow

pip install pillow

vi. Matplotlib

pip install matplotlib

vii. H5py

pip install h5py

viii. Keras

pip install keras

ix. ImageAI

pip3 install https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/2.0.2/imageai-2.0.2-py3-none-any.whl

Download the RetinaNet model file that will be used for object detection via the below link.. place the file in project folder
https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5


***********************************

To run the script:
Go to the project folder and type the following command... "python <NAMEOFTHEPROJECT.py>", here it is --> "python object_recognition.py"

After script running,
Go to project folder and open "imagenew.jpeg" and check extractedimages folder

Cheers!
